# üöÄ Figma To Digia JsonComponents Parser

## Task

The main objective of this project is to convert html/css from figma design files to a digia project page ui. So used Figma, OpenAi(Custom Model for transformation) and dart parser.

## Overview

This project implements a sophisticated parser designed to convert Figma JSON representations into a streamlined JSON format compatible with Digia Components. Leveraging OpenAi custom Models for converting html/css to flutter widget tree json dynamic programming techniques and adhering to SOLID principles for the parser recursively processes each element in the Figma JSON, optimizing and extracting valuable data.

## Key Features üîß
- **OpenAi:** Used OpenAi custom Model for converting html/css into flutter widget tree json and thus parsing that json into digia format using the parser written in dart;
- **Dynamic Programming:** The parser employs dynamic programming techniques to efficiently process and optimize the complex structure of Figma JSON.
- **SOLID Principles:** The implementation adheres to SOLID principles, ensuring a modular and maintainable design that facilitates extensibility.
- **Recursive Parsing:** All elements within the Figma JSON are parsed recursively, extracting essential information and converting them into a linear and memoized structure compatible with Digia Components.

 ## Usage üìë

To use the parser, follow these steps:

1. [https://github.com/Satendra9984/figma_to_digiaJson](#) to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the parser with your Figma JSON file as input.
4. Obtain the optimized Digia Components JSON output.

## Challenges and Fun üí°

Developing this parser presented a stimulating and challenging problem-solving experience. The combination of dynamic programming and adherence to SOLID principles ensures not only efficiency in processing but also a robust and maintainable codebase.

Feel free to explore the codebase, contribute, or use the parser in your projects. Happy coding!

üìÇ **Figma JSON File:** [figma.json](figma.json)

üìÇ **Digia JSON File:** [final_digia.json](final_digia.json)
